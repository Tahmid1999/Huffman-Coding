# Huffman-Coding
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. Besides compressing the data, this code will automatically generate five txt files. 
input.txt -> Our input text 
frequency_table.txt -> Frequency of the letters.  
code_table.txt -> generated code for every letters. 
code.txt -> Huffman Code 
output.txt -> Decompress from Huffman code.
